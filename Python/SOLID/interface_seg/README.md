# Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)

The child class should behave like the parent class in a way that the program continues to work as expected. It ensures
that any code that works with the parent class can also work with the child class without any problems.

For example:

- If you have a class "Animal" and a subclass "Dog," then anywhere in the program that uses "Animal," you should be able
  to use "Dog" and the program will still work just fine.
